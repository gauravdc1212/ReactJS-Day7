// The candidate key can uniquely Identify any row or tuple .
// Composite key - Name + address 
// Primary Key - It is the Unique and not null key, among existing candidate key database designer can select one of the candidate key to identify each row(tuple)
// uniquely is known as Primary key .
// Alternate keys - rest of the candidate keys are known as the Alternate Key
// Super Key - 
// Physical address = Mac Address 48 bits
// ip address = Logical Address 32 bits 0-255

// Design a automata that contain at least one zero over the input 0 and 1.
